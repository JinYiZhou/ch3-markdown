# Exercise-3

As described in the [git-basics chapter](https://info201.github.io/git-basics.html), you should begin by forking this repository, then cloning it to your local machine (if you haven't already).

In the space below, you'll provide some information about a terminal command you've learned thus far in the class. In particular, you should include the following:

A `heading` with the name of the command
An example of how it can be used (with appropriate code highlighting)
A _nested list_ of information about the command (i.e., things that it does, or how it can be used)

# **cd**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
The `cd [directory]` is used to switch to another directory. An example:
```
cd [Desktop]
```
- how it works
  - changes from one directory to another
    - very useful
  
See `complete` branch for answers.
